# Github Finder

An app using the official GitHub API to search for and display user info.

This is refactoring into TypeScript of a Brad Traversy tutorial, available [here](https://github.com/bradtraversy/github-finder-app).

A Docker image of this app available on my Docker Hub [profile](https://hub.docker.com/u/ionutinit).
